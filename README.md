RDRPOSTagger for Tibetan
RDRPOSTagger is adaptable for Tibetan texts which are already segmented because the RDRPOSTagger segments texts with words seperated by white space characters which is not the case for Tibetan texts.
RDRPOSTagger requires an inital tagger. For that we need a text where each line is a sequence of WORD/TAG pairs.
See sample training and test sets in the data directory.

We train RDRPOSTagger on goldTibTest.txt with the command : pSCRDRtagger$ python RDRPOSTagger.py train ../data/goldTibTest.txt
Here pSCRDRtagger$ is simply used to denote the current pSCRDRtagger source package. Note : the text should be already segmented.
A .DICT lexicon file and an .RDR trained model file will be generated in the same directory containing the gold standard training corpus.

To employ the trained model for POS tagging on a raw unlabeled text corpus : pSCRDRtagger$ python RDRPOSTagger.py tag PATH-TO-TRAINED-MODEL PATH-TO-LEXICON PATH-TO-RAW-TEXT-CORPUS
Exemple : pSCRDRtagger$ python RDRPOSTagger.py tag ../data/goldTibTest.txt.RDR ../data/goldTibTest.txt.DICT ../data/rawTest
A .TAGGED file, in this case rawTest.TAGGED, will be generated in the same directory containing the raw text corpus.

Note :
The training text goldTibTest.txt is a syllable part-of-speech tagged corpus of Tibetan texts generated by Tibetan in Digital Communication research project (link : http://larkpie.net/tibetancorpus/ ).
Modifications made to the original vertical format text : 
1) with simple ctrl+F click, we transformed WORD  tag - sequence into WORD/TAG sequence.
2) deleted all the repetitions of the WORD/TAG sequences and arranging them in Tibetan alphabetical order with the command sort -u
3) completed the missing tags with simple tags like n for any kind of nouns except for proper nouns.
